                    <li>-¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>-¼ cup dry sake or mirin</li>

                    <li>-1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                    <li>-½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>-2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4 thighs)</li>
                    <li>-Neutral oil, for frying (such as vegetable, rice bran, or canola)</li>
                    <li>-¾ cup (about 3 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>-¼ cup (about 1 3/8 ounces) potato starch  or 1/4 cup (about 1 1/8 ounce) cornstarch</li>
                    <li>-Lemon wedges</li>
                    <li>-Shichimi togarashi</li>
                    <br/>
                    <h1>Directions</h1>
                    <li>Step 1-Whisk together soy sauce, sake, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. If using bone-in chicken thighs, carefully remove bones using a sharp knife to cut around bones; discard bones or reserve for stock. Cut chicken thighs into 2-inch pieces. Gently stir chicken into soy sauce mixture until fully coated; cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Step 2-Pour oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches (about 6 cups) in a medium Dutch oven and heat over medium until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325°F.</li>
                    <li>Step 3-While oil is heating, place flour in one shallow dish and place potato starch in a second shallow dish. Working with a few pieces at a time, remove chicken from marinade, shaking off excess marinade. Add chicken to flour, and toss gently to coat; shake off any excess flour. Add chicken to potato starch, and toss gently to coat; shake off any excess. Repeat process with remaining chicken pieces.</li>
                    <li>Step 4-Line a large rimmed baking sheet with paper towels; place a wire rack over paper towels. Working in about 4 batches, add dredged chicken pieces to hot oil. Cook, gently stirring often, until light golden brown, about 90 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces, returning oil temperature at 325°F between batches.</li>
                    <li>Step 5-Increase heat to medium-high, and heat oil until deep-fry thermometer registers 350°F. Adjust heat as needed to maintain temperature. Working in batches, add fried chicken pieces to hot oil, and fry, gently stirring often, until golden brown and crispy and a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of chicken piece registers 165°F, about 45 seconds. Remove chicken from oil using a spider or slotted spoon; transfer to prepared baking sheet. Continue process with remaining chicken pieces, letting oil temperature return to 350°F between batches. Serve hot, and garnish with lemon wedges and shichimi togarashi.</li>
